Here's a structured description for the project architecture you've outlined:

**Project Architecture Overview**

The project is developed using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, following a structured architecture for scalability and maintainability.

**Folder Structure:**

1. **SRC Folder:**
   - Contains all source code for the project.

2. **Components:**
   - **Elements:** Includes basic building blocks like buttons and inputs.
   - **UI:** Houses reusable UI components such as navigation bars, footers, and card tiles.
   - **Modules:** Contains modules corresponding to different sections of the site (e.g., home, products).
     - **Home:** Specific components for the home page reside here.
   - **Layout:** Wraps the entire application for consistent styling and layout across pages.

3. **Pages:**
   - Each file corresponds to a specific route/page in the application. These files render the UI and handle logic specific to each page.

4. **Styles:**
   - Holds global and component-specific styles written in CSS to maintain separation of concerns and enhance reusability.

**Explanation:**

- **Components:** Organized into subfolders (Elements, UI, Modules, Layout) for clarity and to facilitate easy access and management of different types of components.
- **Pages:** Each route/page is directly represented as a file within this directory, following Next.js conventions for routing and SSR (Server-Side Rendering).
- **Styles:** Contains all styling concerns, ensuring styles are scoped appropriately to components and globally where needed.

This architecture promotes modularity, making it easier to add new features, maintain existing ones, and scale the application effectively.
